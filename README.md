# VBA-challenge
Wall Street Stock Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze real stock data from Wall Street. Stock data was tabulated by ticker type for one-year periods in order to compare their 'yearly change', 'percentage change', and 'total stock volume' values. Additionally, it was desired to determine the ticker types with the greatest changes, so a small summary table was created to display those.

A VBA subroutine was written to pull raw data, perform calculations, and place the calculated values in tables on multiple sheets. Additionally, another subroutine was created to empty all the created tables.
