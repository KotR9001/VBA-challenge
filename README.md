Wall Street Stock Analysis

Did this project to analyze real stock data from Wall Street. Tabulated stock data by ticker type for one-year periods in order to compare their 'yearly change', 'percentage change', and 'total stock volume' values. Created a small summary table to display the ticker types with the greatest changes.

Wrote a VBA subroutine to pull raw data, perform calculations, and place the calculated values in tables on multiple sheets. Additionally, another subroutine was created to empty all the created tables.
